  # Zoom in to Great Lakes region
  #### add Canada to the map ####
  #### add Lake Erie to the map ###
  #### add Detroit, Chicago, Toronto as points to the map ####
  #### Use UTM 14N (26914) -- add get same view
  
  
  ### Next -- manually add points ####
  ### Manually add lines ####
  ### Manually add text ####
