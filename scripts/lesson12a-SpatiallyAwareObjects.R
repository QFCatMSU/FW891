  #### Save the plot to a file (to open later)

  #### Application
  #    1) Make these changes to plot2:
  #    - position the compass on the right side and centered vertically
  #    - position scale at the top-center 
  #        - you need to one of the padding subcomponents
  #    - make the scale width about 30% of the plot
  #    - increase the height of the scale bar (note: you can use cm or in)
  #    - (approximately) double the size of the compass without 
  #       changing the aspect ratio (i.e., the shape stays the same)
  #    - Add two latitude lines at 40 and 50 degrees
  #       - color the lines red
  #       - use annotation_spatial_hline 
  
  #   2) Add the compass and scale to a plot with your spatial data
  #    - include at least three subcomponent changes for both scale and compass
  #    - Add two green longitude lines
